### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Girlana, a young computer science student about to graduate. I'm working on a research project in partnership with Motorola and I'm currently focused on improving my skills in log mining on Android devices.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on leveraging logs for insights in Android development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m diving into the realms of Machine Learning, Model Prediction, and the world of logs mining.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in epic movie sagas like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. ðŸŽ¬âœ¨

Let's connect, share ideas, and build amazing things together! ðŸš€
